## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in WaaSuP, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to freetools@comptrio.com
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] WaaSuP Vulnerability Report`
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Resolution**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

- **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had time to address it
- **Do not** access, modify, or delete data belonging to others
- **Do not** perform actions that could harm service availability
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly

## Security Considerations

### OAuth 2.1 Authentication

**Potential Risks:**
- Token leakage or interception
- Insufficient scope validation
- Session hijacking
- Authorization code interception

**Mitigations:**
- All tokens use cryptographically secure generation
- HTTPS enforcement for all OAuth endpoints
- Token expiration and rotation policies
- Scope-based access control validation
- Secure session management with proper entropy

### Database Security

**Potential Risks:**
- SQL injection attacks
- Unauthorized data access
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure through logs

**Mitigations:**
- All queries use prepared statements with parameter binding
- Database user principle of least privilege
- Connection encryption (TLS)
- Sensitive data sanitization in logs
- Regular security updates for database systems

### Web Server & API Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- HTTP header injection
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Denial of Service (DoS)

**Mitigations:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS policy enforcement
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Request size limitations
- Secure HTTP headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Regular security scanner audits

### MCP Protocol Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Malicious tool execution
- Resource access violations
- Protocol-level injection attacks
- Session state manipulation

**Mitigations:**
- Tool execution sandboxing
- Resource access controls
- JSON-RPC input validation
- Session state integrity checks
- Tool capability restrictions based on authentication context

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Connection hijacking
- Event stream manipulation
- Memory exhaustion attacks
- Cross-origin data leakage

**Mitigations:**
- Authentication required for SSE connections
- Connection timeout enforcement
- Memory usage monitoring
- Origin validation for cross-domain requests

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS Only**
   - Force HTTPS redirects
   - Implement HSTS headers
   - Use strong TLS configurations

2. **Environment Security**
   - Keep PHP and dependencies updated
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Implement proper file permissions
   - Regular security patches

3. **Database Configuration**
   - Use dedicated database users with minimal privileges
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
   - Regular database security updates
   - Implement database firewall rules

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Enable comprehensive security logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
   - Set up alerting for security events
   - Regular log analysis and retention policies

### For Integration

1. **Laravel Integration**
   - Use Laravel's built-in security features
   - Implement proper middleware chains
   - Follow Laravel security best practices
   - Regular framework updates

2. **Slim Framework Integration**
   - Use PSR-15 middleware for security layers
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow PSR security standards
   - Regular framework updates

3. **Custom Tool Development**
   - Validate all tool inputs
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use least privilege principles
   - Audit tool capabilities regularly

## Vulnerability Categories

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass

- Data breach vulnerabilities

### High (Fix within 7 days)
- Privilege escalation
- Sensitive data exposure
- Cross-site scripting (stored)
- SQL injection

### Medium (Fix within 30 days)
- Cross-site scripting (reflected)
- Information disclosure
- Session management issues
- Input validation bypass

### Low (Fix within 90 days)
- Configuration issues
- Information leakage

## Security Testing

We encourage security testing of WaaSuP with the following guidelines:

### Permitted Testing
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Local environment testing
- Automated security scanning tools

### Prohibited Testing
- Testing against production systems without permission
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security testing
- Testing that disrupts service availability
- Accessing data that doesn't belong to you

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1 â†’ 1.0.2)
- Documented in the CHANGELOG.md
- Announced through GitHub Security Advisories
- Tagged with security impact level

## Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:
- **Composer**: Using `composer audit` for PHP dependencies
- **GitHub**: Dependabot security alerts enabled
- **Manual Review**: Quarterly dependency security review

## Compliance

WaaSuP is designed to support compliance with:
- **OAuth 2.1**: Full specification compliance
- **PSR Standards**: PSR-7, PSR-15 HTTP security standards
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy by design
- **OWASP**: Following OWASP Top 10 security practices
